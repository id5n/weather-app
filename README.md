# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
### V1/Original:
This project was based on the Weather API exercise presented by the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program. The prompt required you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. At the time, instructions were as follows:

<h4>Files:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `app/app.js` file.</li>
    <li>You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Required Dependencies:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>This project utilizes `cors` and `body-parser` so you should make sure they are installed through the command line. 
    <li>Also, the Node server uses Express, so make sure this is set up as well.</li>
</ul>
